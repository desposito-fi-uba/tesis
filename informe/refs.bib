	abstract = {With the proliferation of mobile devices and hearing devices, including hearing aids
	and cochlear implants, there is a growing and pressing need to design algorithms that
	can improve speech intelligibility without sacrificing quality. Responding to this
	need, Speech Enhancement: Theory and Practice, Second Edition introduces readers to
	the basic problems of speech enhancement and the various algorithms proposed to solve
	these problems. Updated and expanded, this second edition of the bestselling textbook
	broadens its scope to include evaluation measures and enhancement algorithms aimed
	at improving speech intelligibility. Fundamentals, Algorithms, Evaluation, and Future
	Steps Organized into four parts, the book begins with a review of the fundamentals
	needed to understand and design better speech enhancement algorithms. The second part
	describes all the major enhancement algorithms and, because these require an estimate
	of the noise spectrum, also covers noise estimation algorithms. The third part of
	the book looks at the measures used to assess the performance, in terms of speech
	quality and intelligibility, of speech enhancement methods. It also evaluates and
	compares several of the algorithms. The fourth part presents binary mask algorithms
	for improving speech intelligibility under ideal conditions. In addition, it suggests
	steps that can be taken to realize the full potential of these algorithms under realistic
	conditions. Whats New in This Edition Updates in every chapter A new chapter on objective
	speech intelligibility measures A new chapter on algorithms for improving speech intelligibility
	Real-world noise recordings (on accompanying CD) MATLAB code for the implementation
	of intelligibility measures (on accompanying CD) MATLAB and C/C++ code for the implementation
	of algorithms to improve speech intelligibility (on accompanying CD) Valuable Insights
	from a Pioneer in Speech Enhancement Clear and concise, this book explores how human
	listeners compensate for acoustic noise in noisy environments. Written by a pioneer
	in speech enhancement and noise reduction in cochlear implants, it is an essential
	resource for anyone who wants to implement or incorporate the latest speech enhancement
	algorithms to improve the quality and intelligibility of speech degraded by noise.
	Includes a CD with Code and Recordings The accompanying CD provides MATLAB implementations
	of representative speech enhancement algorithms as well as speech and noise databases
	for the evaluation of enhancement algorithms.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OM-LSA) speech estimator and a minima controlled recursive averaging (MCRA) noise estimation approach for robust speech enhancement. The spectral gain function, which minimizes the mean-square error of the log-spectra, is obtained as a weighted geometric mean of the hypothetical gains associated with the speech presence uncertainty. The noise estimate is given by averaging past spectral power values, using a smoothing parameter that is adjusted by the speech presence probability in subbands. We introduce two distinct speech presence probability functions, one for estimating the speech and one for controlling the adaptation of the noise spectrum. The former is based on the time–frequency distribution of the a priori signal-to-noise ratio. The latter is determined by the ratio between the local energy of the noisy signal and its minimum within a specified time window. Objective and subjective evaluation under various environmental conditions confirm the superiority of the OM-LSA and MCRA estimators. Excellent noise suppression is achieved, while retaining weak speech components and avoiding the musical residual noise phenomena.}
